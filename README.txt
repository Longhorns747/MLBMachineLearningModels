Hi :D

I used Weka for my experiements and analysis, so you should too!

In the "Training Sets" folder you will find both of my datasets already pre-processed into ARFF files for use in Weka. By loading them into Weka, you can run the same experiments I did and produce the same models that are located in the "Models" folder.

They don't take too long to generate on a reasonable machine, and this is the exact procedure I went through to generate the results I discuss in my analysis.

Alternatively, you can load the models provided in the "Models" folder into Weka and run percentages (or the entirity) of my data to get results similar to those in my paper.

I have saved the result buffers of all of my experiments and placed them into the "Results" folder as TXT files. You'll be able to see tons of information on the results of my experiments there.
